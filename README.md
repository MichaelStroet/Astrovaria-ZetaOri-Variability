# Determining the mass loss variation of the O-type supergiant star Î¶ Orionis Aa
### Astrovaria project 2023
Student: Michael Stroet
Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Alex de Koter & Frank Backs MSc

In this project, I used the stellar atmospheric modelling code FASTWIND to model observations of the O-type supergiant Zeta Ori with the aim of investigating the origin of the observed spread in mass loss through stellar winds as a function of luminosity. The potential cause I have investigated in this project, is a variability in the mass loss of a star as the observed spread in values uses only single measurements of mass loss per star.

After modelling the spectra, I did find a change in the observed values of mass loss over time. However, taking into account the degeneracy between mass loss and wind clumping, the resulting variation is too small to explain the observed spread of mass loss. From the results, it is clear that the wind structure of Zeta Ori is irregular and far from spherically symmetric. As FASTWIND is fitting a 1D spherically-symmetric model to a 3D strucutre, these models might be too simplistic to accurately model the atmospheres of such variable stars.

The written report is currently under review and will be added to this repository at a later date.

The observations used were taken in 2018 by Annelotte Derkink MSc and Anniek Gloudemans MSc using the HERMES instrument of the Mercator telescope on La Palma.

The version of FASTWIND used during this project is V10.6.
